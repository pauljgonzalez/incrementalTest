Right now it resets every page load. Will have to learn localStorage and using JSON files maybe.

This is just mainly to test around making a very basic incremental game. And to improve my web dev skill

Concept is just going to be a basic increase health,defense,attack to beat boss.

Not sure how much time I will spend on balancing.

Bosses will be changed by clicking arrows to go the next one. 

Might add shop to buy items but thats not in the MVP. If I do I will have to have bosses drop gold.
